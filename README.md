# CS3200-E-commerce-database-design
This project discusses the database design for my e-commerce website locartz. The database includes all the basic requirements of a shopping website. This is the basis of a project that can help local retailers to sell their products online. My systems offer simple architectures which makes online shopping less complicated for people who are not into technology. This project can not only help people buy products online but will also help beginners to understand how to design their own ecommerce website. Understanding the structure of e-commerce database systems will help database designers effectively develop and maintain e-commerce systems.
